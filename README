## BookWander Technical Overview

BookWander’s ecosystem consists of a series of interrelated system components, without which the functionality of the whole system wouldn’t be possible or wouldn’t be as good an experience for users.

### Frontend Client

The user interface of BookWander consists of a frontend client – made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – with which users interact, and a backend server that interprets and manages queries and responses sent between the client and the database. React.js or Angular.js techs, for instance, help develop a client-side, visually appealing web application that can respond to users in real-time.

### Backend Server

A Node.js server at the back end —implementing RESTful APIs for client-server communication — powers this platform.
In this paragraph, the first two sentences refer to the software that a user installs to utilize the capabilities on their device. It is commonly understood that the browser object in the third sentence — running on the device side — would in turn communicate with the Node.js server at the back end.

### Database Management

Another component of BookWander that stores and retrieves information is a relational data-base-management system (RDBMS) – in this application, we used a MySQL database to take advantage of its fast and scalable structure to store items such as user profiles, book catalogue data, reviews and more.
